# vita
is an abbreviation for Vital Introduction To Algorithms.

The goals of the project are:
* allow @saikro/@saikro-student go through a [book](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/introduction-algorithms);
* study algorithms/data structures presented in it;
* train skill to apply covered algorithms to solve real problems;
* improve the knowldge in modern C++;

It is Vital for @saikro/@saikro-student as the topic were taught in the university on the level not enough for @saikro's current job activity and future plans.

The project is going to contain the solutions of the excercises and problems provided by the book. They are planned to be written in C++ and tested with [Gmock](https://github.com/google/googlemock).
